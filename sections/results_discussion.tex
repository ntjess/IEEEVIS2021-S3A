\section{Results}
To evaluate these claims against other popular annotation software, an experiment will be carried out to annotate images exhibiting high resolution, numerous foreground regions, and high ROI complexity. Total time required to annotate the images will be compared against the resulting accuracy to show the quantitative effects of the features proposed here.
